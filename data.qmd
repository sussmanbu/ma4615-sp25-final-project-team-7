# Dataset 1: U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)

## Where to Find the Data
This dataset was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It was developed through a collaborative effort involving the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors.

The dataset can be accessed directly from the CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Portal: [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data)

## Why Was This Data Collected?
The CDI dataset was created to support public health surveillance, policy development, and program planning at both the state and national levels. It provides a standardized way for different states and territories to define, collect, and report chronic disease data, allowing for consistent comparisons across different regions and demographics.

The data is collected from multiple sources, including:

- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

- Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)

- National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)

- United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)

- Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Data

Because the dataset compiles information from multiple sources, each data source has its own methodology, limitations, and potential biases. For example, BRFSS relies on telephone surveys, which may underrepresent individuals without stable phone access, and YRBSS focuses only on high school students, potentially excluding young people who are not enrolled in school. These factors must be carefully considered when analyzing the data.

## Key Variables in Our Analysis
The original dataset consists of 309,215 rows and 34 columns, covering 115 chronic disease indicators across multiple health topics. Since our analysis focuses on racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence and management, we have selected the following key variables:

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressWarnings(library(knitr))

# Create a data frame of key variables
key_variables <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("YearStart", "LocationDesc", "Topic", "Question", 
               "DataValueType", "DataValue", "StratificationID1", "StratificationCategory1"),
  Description = c("The year the data was collected (2015-2022)", 
                  "The state or territory where the data was collected",
                  "The general category of the health data (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Mental Health)",
                  "A specific health-related question (e.g., 'Diabetes among adults')",
                  "The type of data value (e.g., Crude Prevalence, Age-Adjusted Rate)",
                  "The actual numerical value associated with a given health indicator",
                  "The specific stratification variable (e.g., 'BLK' for Black, 'WHT' for White, 'HIS' for Hispanic)",
                  "The category of stratification (e.g., Race/Ethnicity, Age, Gender)")
)

## Data Imbalances and Distribution
![](images/Topic-BarChart.png)
Upon reviewing the dataset, we identified imbalances in data coverage across different health topics. Some health conditions, such as Cardiovascular Disease, Nutrition/Physical Activity/Weight, and Health Status, have over 19,000 recorded values, while others, such as Maternal Health and Chronic Kidney Disease, have fewer than 1,000 entries.

Additionally, the LocationDesc variable appears to be mostly evenly distributed, suggesting that each state or territory is proportionately represented in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed the following cleaning steps:

- **Selected Relevant Variables:** We reduced the dataset to the eight most important columns related to disease prevalence, stratification categories, and geographic information.

- **Removed Missing Values:** We used the na.omit() function to exclude any incomplete data points.

- **Filtered Out Extreme Outliers:** Using a box plot analysis, we identified and removed eight unusually large values (greater than 1,000,000) in the DataValue column.

- **Checked for Unusual Frequencies:** We visualized category distributions to detect imbalances in health topic coverage.

# Dataset 2: Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) using the American Community Survey (ACS)

## Where to Find the Data
This dataset was published within the United States Census Bureau. The dataset can be accessed directly from the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates website: [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/sahie/estimates-acs.html)

## Why Was This Data Collected?
The Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program was created to develop model-based estimates of health insurance coverage for counties and states. This program builds on the work of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program. SAHIE is the only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates.

SAHIE data can be used to analyze geographic variation in health insurance coverage, as well as disparities in coverage by race/ethnicity, sex, age and income levels that reflect thresholds for state and federal assistance programs. Because consistent estimates are available from 2008 to 2022, SAHIE reflects annual changes over time.

For 2008-2022, SAHIE publishes state and county estimates of population with and without health insurance coverage, along with measures of uncertainty, for the full cross-classification of:

- **5 age categories:** 0-64, 18-64, 21-64, 40-64, and 50-64

- **3 sex categories:** Both sexes, Male, and Female

- **6 income categories:** All incomes, as well as the following income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories: 0-138%, 0-200%, 0-250%, 0-400%, and 138-400% of the poverty threshold

- **8 races/ethnicities (for states only):** All races/ethnicities, White alone (not Hispanic or Latino), Black or African American alone (not Hispanic or Latino), American Indian and Alaska Native alone (not Hispanic or Latino), Asian alone (not Hispanic or Latino), Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone (not Hispanic or Latino), Two or More Races (not Hispanic or Latino), Hispanic or Latino (any race).


## Key Variables in Our Analysis
The original dataset consisted of 338,850 rows and 26 columns. Since the SAHIE files are large and updated yearly, we decided to focus on just the year 2022, since it is the most recent year on file. After cleaning out this dataset to better align with the aim of our analysis, it now contains 37,026 observations with 11 variables. This cleaned dataset allows us to analyze health insurance coverage across different states in a more focused manner, examining how it varies by sex, race, and age, as well as how income levels affect insurance ratesâ€”particularly in relation to the topics covered in our first dataset.

We have selected the following key variables for our analysis:

- Age
- Race
- Sex
- Income
- NIPR
- NUI
- NIC
- PCTUI
- PCTIC
- Location
