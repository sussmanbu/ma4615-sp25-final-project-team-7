## Where to Find the Data
The dataset used in this analysis is the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset, which is published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset was developed through a collaborative effort involving the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors.

The dataset can be accessed directly from the CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Portal: [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data)

## Why Was This Data Collected?
The CDI dataset was created to support public health surveillance, policy development, and program planning at both the state and national levels. It provides a standardized way for different states and territories to define, collect, and report chronic disease data, allowing for consistent comparisons across different regions and demographics.

The data is collected from multiple sources, including:

- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

- Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)

- National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)

- United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)

- Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Data

Because the dataset compiles information from multiple sources, each data source has its own methodology, limitations, and potential biases. For example, BRFSS relies on telephone surveys, which may underrepresent individuals without stable phone access, and YRBSS focuses only on high school students, potentially excluding young people who are not enrolled in school. These factors must be carefully considered when analyzing the data.

## Key Variables in Our Analysis
The original dataset consists of 309,215 rows and 34 columns, covering 115 chronic disease indicators across multiple health topics. Since our analysis focuses on racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence and management, we have selected the following key variables:

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressWarnings(library(knitr))

# Create a data frame of key variables
key_variables <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("YearStart", "LocationDesc", "Topic", "Question", 
               "DataValueType", "DataValue", "StratificationID1", "StratificationCategory1"),
  Description = c("The year the data was collected (2015-2022)", 
                  "The state or territory where the data was collected",
                  "The general category of the health data (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Mental Health)",
                  "A specific health-related question (e.g., 'Diabetes among adults')",
                  "The type of data value (e.g., Crude Prevalence, Age-Adjusted Rate)",
                  "The actual numerical value associated with a given health indicator",
                  "The specific stratification variable (e.g., 'BLK' for Black, 'WHT' for White, 'HIS' for Hispanic)",
                  "The category of stratification (e.g., Race/Ethnicity, Age, Gender)")
)

## Data Imbalances and Distribution
![](images/Topic-BarChart.png)
Upon reviewing the dataset, we identified imbalances in data coverage across different health topics. Some health conditions, such as Cardiovascular Disease, Nutrition/Physical Activity/Weight, and Health Status, have over 19,000 recorded values, while others, such as Maternal Health and Chronic Kidney Disease, have fewer than 1,000 entries.

Additionally, the LocationDesc variable appears to be mostly evenly distributed, suggesting that each state or territory is proportionately represented in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed the following cleaning steps:

- **Selected Relevant Variables:** We reduced the dataset to the eight most important columns related to disease prevalence, stratification categories, and geographic information.

- **Removed Missing Values:** We used the na.omit() function to exclude any incomplete data points.

- **Filtered Out Extreme Outliers:** Using a box plot analysis, we identified and removed eight unusually large values (greater than 1,000,000) in the DataValue column.

- **Checked for Unusual Frequencies:** We visualized category distributions to detect imbalances in health topic coverage.

#### Cleaning Script:
For full transparency, our data cleaning script is available for review: [Cleaning Script](/scripts/clean_data.R)

## Additional Notes
- No variable renaming or recoding was necessary, as the dataset already had clear labels.
- No additional R packages were used outside of standard libraries covered in class (dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2).
