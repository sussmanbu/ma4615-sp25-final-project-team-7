This week we worked on importing and cleaning out data. We first imported the US Chronic Disease Indicator CSV file. From there, we cleaned up the data by selecting specific columns to analyze: YearStart, LocationDesc, Topic, Question, DataValueType, DataValue, StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategoryID1, and StratificationID1.\

Variable Description:

YearStart: The year when the data was collected

LocationDesc: State

Topic: The general category of the health data

Question: A specific health-related question

DataValueType: The type of data value (e.g., mean, median, prevalence ).

DataValue: The actual numerical value.

StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategoryID1, and StratificationID1: Variables relating to age, sex, and race/ethnicity
