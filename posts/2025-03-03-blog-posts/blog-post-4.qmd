This week, we built upon our exploratory data analysis and identified some discrepancies related to age data. Specifically, we found inconsistencies in the age groups within the StratificationID1 column. To better understand how these discrepancies might impact the analysis of different health conditions, we first examined the extent to which each age group had been analyzed.

From the graph above, it became clear that not all health conditions were analyzed for every age group, and there was a lack of consistency in the age group ranges. For example, we observed both a 10-14 age group and a 12-17 age group, which indicate overlap and potential misclassification. We took these findings into account as we continued with our analysis.


Next, we decided to investigate health disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Specifically, we visualized how the prevalence of four health outcomes—Arthritis, Asthma, Disability, and Mental Health—varies by race and ethnicity.

The bar chart shown above highlights clear disparities, with some conditions disproportionately affecting specific racial groups. For example, Multiracial and American Indian/Alaska Native groups consistently show higher average rates across multiple conditions, particularly for Disability and Mental Health, while Asian populations generally report lower values across the board. This visualization offers a meaningful entry point into the structural inequities embedded in public health outcomes and suggests important directions for deeper statistical analysis.

To explore these relationships more rigorously, we fit a set of simple linear regression models to predict each of the four health outcome rates using three main predictors: YearStart, Location, and Race/Ethnicity (via the StratificationID1 column). A small portion of our modeling results is shown above; the modeling results confirmed some patterns from the EDA. For example, in the Disability model, race emerged as a significant predictor: the coefficients for American Indian/Alaska Native (+14.78), Multiracial (+10.53), and Hispanic (+3.23) were all statistically significant with p-values < 0.001, indicating strong disparities. Similarly, in the Arthritis model, race also showed significance: the Asian group had a significantly lower rate (−10.96), while the Black and Multiracial groups had higher average rates. Location was also an important factor in many models, with states like California, New York, and Maryland frequently showing significant coefficients. While these are just initial models, they already suggest important structural differences in chronic disease rates by both race and geography. Moving forward, we hope to refine these models and explore potential mediating variables such as social determinants of health.
