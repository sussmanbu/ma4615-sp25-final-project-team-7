# Secondary Dataset: [Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) using the American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/sahie/estimates-acs.html)

This week, our team has decided we will be combining the SAHIE dataset with our original dataset for a more in-depth analysis of chronic disease indicators. Since the SAHIE files are large and updated yearly, we are focusing on the year 2022, since it is the most recent year on file. The SAHIE dataset provides information on estimates of health insurance coverage from the American Community Survey (ACS), as well as providing valuable information on race, age, sex, and state. We hope to further analyze how income level affects the chronic disease indicators per state, across different races/ethnic groups, as lower income levels may have less resources available to seek out treatment
