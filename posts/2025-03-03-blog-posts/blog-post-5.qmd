# Secondary Dataset: [Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) using the American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/sahie/estimates-acs.html)


This week, our team has decided we will be combining the SAHIE dataset with our original dataset for a more in-depth analysis of chronic disease indicators. Since the SAHIE files are large and updated yearly, we are focusing on the year 2022, since it is the most recent year on file. The SAHIE dataset provides information on estimates of health insurance coverage from the American Community Survey (ACS), as well as providing valuable information on race, age, sex, and state. We hope to further analyze how income level affects the chronic disease indicators per state, across different races/ethnic groups, as lower income levels may have less resources available to seek out treatment.

This week, our team has decided we will be combining the SAHIE dataset with our original dataset (CDI - Chronic Disease Indicators) for a more in-depth analysis of chronic disease indicators. Since the SAHIE files are large and updated yearly, we are focusing on just the year 2022 for now, since it is the most recent year on file. The SAHIE dataset provides valuable information about health insurance coverage, as well as demographic factors such as race, age, sex, and income from the American Community Survey (ACS). By combining this with the CDI dataset, which focuses on chronic disease indicators across different states, we aim to explore how insurance coverage and income levels might influence chronic disease outcomes in various racial and ethnic groups.

The process of combining the two datasets began with cleaning and standardizing the SAHIE dataset. One of the most difficult parts of combining our two datasets was making sure the columns we wanted to merge on were consistent between both datasets. Therefore, we selected relevant columns, such as the year, race, sex, age, and income categories, and renamed them to align with the CDI dataset. In addition, we recoded categorical variables for race, age, sex, and income to ensure consistency between both datasets. For instance, we recoded race/ethnicity values from numeric codes in the SAHIE dataset (e.g., 1 for White, 2 for Black) into more descriptive categories like "WHT" for White, "BLK" for Black, and so on. We also standardized the age and income categories for better alignment.

After cleaning the SAHIE dataset, we turned our attention to the CDI dataset. We filtered it to include only data from 2022 and focused on race/ethnicity stratifications, placing them into their own Race column. Additionally, we removed certain regions (e.g., Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico) from the CDI dataset, as they were not included within the SAHIE dataset. Once both datasets were cleaned and standardized, we proceeded with merging them using a left join on key columns: Year, LocationDesc (for state), and Race. This left join ensures that all rows from the CDI dataset are retained, and the matching data from the SAHIE dataset (providing health insurance coverage estimates) are added based on these common columns. This merged dataset will allow us to conduct more comprehensive analyses of how factors like insurance coverage, race, and income relate to chronic disease indicators in different states.
