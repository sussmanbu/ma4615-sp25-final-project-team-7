**Updates:**

This week, we worked on reviewing the article on Data for Equity Principals and relating it to our own data. The first principle that we noted was the principle of justice, which emphasizes that the benefits and burdens of data collection should be fairly distributed. In public health research, some communities—particularly marginalized racial groups are frequently the subjects of study but do not always benefit from the findings. The CDI dataset contains health indicators stratified by race, which allows for the examination of disparities. However, it’s important that the analysis doesn’t focus solely on racial differences, but also considers systemic causes like unequal healthcare access and environmental conditions. Additionally, a limitation of our data is that the racial and ethnic groups are aggregated into broad categories (e.g., “black”, “hispanic”, “asian”), which can obscure important within-group differences. A more equitable approach would involve advocating for more granular racial and ethnic data collection, ensuring that diverse communities are accurately represented in health research.

Another principle we considered from the article is beneficence, which requires that data be used to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. When analyzing racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence, it is critical to avoid decontextualized comparisons that could reinforce implicit biases. For example, reporting that a certain racial group has higher obesity rates without discussing economic barriers to healthy food access could place blame on individuals rather than highlighting systemic issues. A responsible approach to beneficence could involve integrating policy implications into the analysis through extraneous datasets, such as how Medicaid expansion, neighborhood investments, or culturally competent healthcare programs might mitigate disparities. Additionally, ensuring that findings are shared with communities in accessible formats (e.g., community briefings, infographics) can help make data more actionable rather than extractive. However, there is potential for misuse if policymakers or media outlets selectively present statistics without context, reinforcing harmful narratives about certain racial groups rather than addressing systemic healthcare inequities. Misinterpretation of the data could lead to policies that once again blame individuals rather than targeting structural barriers to health equity.

We also worked more on our data cleaning by eliminating any NA values and beginning our exploratory data analysis. To check for any unusual quantitative data values/handle outliers, we constructed a box plot using a standardized version of the DataValue column. When viewing the box plot, we noticed that there were 8 values that seemed unusually large, all corresponding to values greater than 1,000,000. Therefore, we filtered these values out of our dataset to prevent them from skewing our results and distorting our overall analysis.

To identify any unusually frequent categorical values, particularly within the Location and Topic columns, we constructed bar charts to visualize their distribution. The Location data appeared relatively evenly distributed, indicating that no single state or territory was disproportionately represented. However, the Topic frequency graph, which is shown above, revealed significant disparities in data coverage across health topics. Certain topics, such as Cardiovascular Disease, Nutrition/Physical Activity/Weight, and Health Status, each had over 19,000 recorded values, whereas others, like Maternal Health and Chronic Kidney Disease, had fewer than 1,000 entries. This imbalance suggests that some chronic health conditions receive considerably more attention in data collection efforts, which may influence the scope of potential analyses and the conclusions drawn from this dataset.
