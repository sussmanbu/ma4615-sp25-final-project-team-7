**Updates:**

This week, we worked on reviewing the article on Data for Equity Principals and relating it to our own data. The first principle that we noted was the principle of justice, which emphasizes that the benefits and burdens of data collection should be fairly distributed. In public health research, some communities—particularly marginalized racial groups—are frequently the subjects of study but do not always benefit from the findings. The CDI dataset contains health indicators stratified by race, which allows for the examination of disparities. However, it is important to ensure that the analysis does not solely focus on racial differences without also addressing systemic causes, such as unequal healthcare access and environmental factors. Additionally, a limitation of our data is that the racial and ethnic groups are aggregated into broad categories (e.g., “black”, “hispanic”, “asian”), which can obscure important within-group differences. A more equitable approach would involve advocating for more granular racial and ethnic data collection, ensuring that diverse communities are accurately represented in health research.

Another principle we considered from the article is beneficence, which requires that data be used to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. When analyzing racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence, it is critical to avoid decontextualized comparisons that could reinforce implicit biases. For example, reporting that a certain racial group has higher obesity rates without discussing economic barriers to healthy food access could place blame on individuals rather than highlighting systemic issues. A responsible approach to beneficence could involve integrating policy implications into the analysis through extraneous datasets, such as how Medicaid expansion, neighborhood investments, or culturally competent healthcare programs might mitigate disparities. Additionally, ensuring that findings are shared with communities in accessible formats (e.g., community briefings, infographics) can help make data more actionable rather than extractive. However, there is potential for misuse if policymakers or media outlets selectively present statistics without context, reinforcing harmful narratives about certain racial groups rather than addressing systemic healthcare inequities. Misinterpretation of the data could lead to policies that once again blame individuals rather than targeting structural barriers to health equity.
