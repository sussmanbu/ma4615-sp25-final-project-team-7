When we think about chronic illness in America, we often picture aging, genetic predisposition, or maybe lifestyle choices like smoking or diet. But beneath these common culprits lies a more systemic, and deeply unequal, truth: **race and insurance status in the United States are powerful predictors of chronic disease** — sometimes more than income or even gender.

Across the country, millions live with conditions like diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and mental health struggles. But our analysis of public health survey data reveals that **minority racial and ethnic groups, especially Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native populations, consistently bear the greatest burden of these conditions**. The reason isn’t just about biology — it’s about access, opportunity, and the uneven structure of the American healthcare system.

## The Burden Isn’t Equal: Chronic Disease by Race

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(here)))
suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))
cdi_data = readRDS(here::here("dataset", "dataclean.rds"))

# Filter for Race/Ethnicity data
race_health <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(StratificationCategory1 == "Race/Ethnicity", 
         (Topic == "Diabetes" & Question == "Diabetes among adults") |
    (Topic == "Asthma" & Question == "Current asthma among adults") |
    (Topic == "Arthritis" & Question == "Arthritis among adults") |
    (Topic == "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" & Question == "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among adults") |
    (Topic == "Alcohol" & Question %in% c("Binge drinking prevalence among adults", "Binge drinking prevalence among high school students")) |
    (Topic == "Mental Health") |
    (Topic == "Disability")) %>%
  group_by(StratificationID1, Topic) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(DataValue, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(StratificationID1 = factor(StratificationID1, 
         levels = c("WHT", "BLK", "HIS", "MRC", "AIAN", "API", "HAPI", "ASN"),
         labels = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Multiracial", 
                    "American Indian/Alaska Native", "Asian/Pacific Islander", 
                    "Hawaiian/Pacific Islander", "Asian")))

# Visual 1: Bar Plot – Chronic Disease Prevalence by Race
ggplot(race_health, aes(x = StratificationID1, y = AverageValue, fill = Topic)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  labs(
    title = "Chronic Illness Has a Race Problem",
    subtitle = "Average prevalence of selected chronic conditions by race/ethnicity",
    x = "Race/Ethnicity",
    y = "Average Prevalence (%)",
    fill = "Health Condition"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```
Our first stop was to look at how often chronic conditions show up across racial and ethnic lines. American Indian/Alaskan Native and Multiracial individuals top the charts in nearly every category, particularly for arthritis, disability, and asthma. Asian Americans, by contrast, had the lowest average prevalence across the board.

These gaps don’t exist in a vacuum, and they’re not due to one or two outlier states. The patterns are national, even when we account for differences by gender and income.

## Preventive Care Isn’t Reaching Everyone

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Define the questions of interest
preventive_questions <- c(
  "Influenza vaccination among adults",
  "Routine checkup within the past year among adults",
  "Colorectal cancer screening among adults aged 45-75 years",
  "Received health care provider counseling for physical activity among adults with arthritis"
)

# Filter the dataset for those questions
preventive_data <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(Question %in% preventive_questions)

# Filter for Race/Ethnicity data and specific preventive measures
preventive_race_data <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(StratificationCategory1 == "Race/Ethnicity", 
         Question %in% preventive_questions) %>%
  group_by(StratificationID1, Question) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(DataValue, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(StratificationID1 = factor(StratificationID1, 
         levels = c("WHT", "BLK", "HIS", "MRC", "AIAN", "API", "HAPI", "ASN"),
         labels = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Multiracial", 
                    "American Indian/Alaska Native", "Asian/Pacific Islander", 
                    "Hawaiian/Pacific Islander", "Asian")))

ggplot(preventive_race_data, aes(x = StratificationID1, y = AverageValue, group = Question, color = Question)) +
  geom_line() +  # Connect points with lines
  geom_point(size = 3) +  # Add points for visibility
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "When Care Comes Too Late",
       subtitle = "Preventive health behaviors vary widely across racial and ethnic groups",
       x = "Race/Ethnicity",
       y = "Participation Rate (%)",
       color = "Preventive Health Measure") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 15, hjust = 1, size = 8),
    axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -1),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.box = "vertical",   # Ensure the legend is stacked vertically
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 2, "cm"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 1))  # Arrange legend items vertically
``` 
Preventive care — the kind of medicine meant to stop chronic illness before it starts — doesn’t reach all communities equally. While most racial groups report regular checkups at similar rates, flu vaccinations and cancer screenings lag behind in Hispanic, Black, and Native communities.

Fewer screenings mean more missed diagnoses. And in many cases, the same groups with the least access to prevention also suffer the most from chronic disease, reinforcing a deadly cycle.

## Insurance Gaps Fuel Health Gaps

```{r}
#| echo: false
merged_data <- readRDS(here("dataset", "merged_data_2022.rds"))
# Again, ensure PCTIC is numeric
data = merged_data
data$PCTIC <- as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", data$PCTIC))

# Summarize insurance rate by race and income
race_income_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Race, Income) %>%
  summarise(
    AvgInsured = mean(PCTIC, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n(),
    , .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(AvgInsured))

# Plot
ggplot(race_income_summary, aes(x = Income, y = AvgInsured, fill = Race)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Even With Money, Some Americans Stay Uninsured",
    subtitle = "Insurance coverage increases with income, but not equally across racial groups",
    x = "Income Level",
    y = "% Insured"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Insurance opens the door to preventive care, but that door isn’t open to everyone. Unsurprisingly, people with higher incomes are more likely to have insurance. But even when we hold income constant, Hispanic and Native American populations still have the lowest insurance coverage.

This means it’s not just about how much money someone makes; it's also about who they are, where they live, and the kinds of barriers they face in getting covered.

## A Structural Problem Needs Structural Solutions

The data are clear: chronic diseases don’t affect all Americans equally, and that inequality is driven in large part by who has access to regular, preventive healthcare — and who doesn’t.

Fixing these disparities will require more than awareness. It means expanding access to affordable coverage. It means building trust in communities where preventive medicine hasn’t been prioritized, or hasn’t been accessible. And it means finally treating healthcare not just as a personal responsibility, but as a public good.

Until then, race will remain a silent but powerful factor in predicting who gets sick, and who gets care.
