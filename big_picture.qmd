This comes from the file `big_picture.qmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this page should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression or a complicated plot. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page


* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a how a news article or a magazine story might draw you in. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* Interactive component
  * Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.
