## Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
This analysis are explore about the race, income , and insurance coversage in the effect of the preventative helathcare in U.S
We are interested in Unsterstanding:
How the uninsurance tare vary across racial and income groups?

Does the populations have higher uninsurance rates less likely to engage in preventative health behaviors? such as vaccination.

How extent can insurance to help the difference social population have the difference in the preventative care?

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(here))
merged_data <- readRDS(here("dataset", "merged_data_2022.rds"))
print(merged_data)

```

## Modeling and Inference

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Again, ensure PCTIC is numeric
data = merged_data
data$PCTIC <- as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", data$PCTIC))

# Summarize insurance rate by race and income
race_income_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Race, Income) %>%
  summarise(
    AvgInsured = mean(PCTIC, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(AvgInsured))

# Print summary
print(race_income_summary)

# Plot
ggplot(race_income_summary, aes(x = Income, y = AvgInsured, fill = Race)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Percent Insured by Race and Income Level",
    x = "Income Level",
    y = "% Insured"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
First, convert the text type of insurance to numeric type to facilitate subsequent calculations, then group by Race and Income, and calculate the average insurance rate for each group. Finally, use ggplot2 to draw a bar chart comparing the average insurance coverage rate of each ethnic group at different income levels. Based the output result, Across all income brackets, AIAN (American Indian/Alaska Native) and HIS (Hispanic) groups show lower insured rates.WHT (White) and ASN (Asian) groups tend to have the highest insurance coverage, often exceeding 90%.Income Level Correlates Positively with Insurance.As we move from <135% poverty to All, there's a general upward trend in insurance coverage across all racial groups.This confirms the expected pattern: higher income is associated with better insurance coverage.

## Flaws and limitations in analysis

No causality – Cross-sectional data only shows associations, not cause-and-effect.

Simplified model – Linear regression may miss complex relationships; omitted variables could bias results.

Small sample sizes – Some racial/income subgroups have limited data, reducing reliability.

Data merging challenges – Combining datasets with different granularities may introduce errors.（Because merging in difference dataset that might have some data differnece )

Unmeasured factors – Missing variables  could influence outcomes.

Aggregation bias – State-level averages may hide local disparities.















## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
