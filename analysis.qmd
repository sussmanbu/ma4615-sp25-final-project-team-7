# Motivation and Research Questions
## Motivation
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the disparities in chronic disease prevalence across different racial and ethnic groups in the United States. This project also seeks to examine the relationship between preventive health measures—such as vaccination rates and cancer screenings—and chronic disease outcomes, with a focus on potential gaps in access and utilization. By incorporating data on income levels and insurance coverage, the analysis aims to uncover how socioeconomic factors contribute to these health disparities. Understanding these relationships can help identify the most influential factors affecting chronic disease prevalence and support efforts to improve health equity and outcomes nationwide.

## Research Questions

1. How does chronic disease prevalence vary among different racial and ethnic groups across U.S. states?

2. What are the patterns of preventive health measure usage (e.g., screenings, vaccinations) among racial and ethnic groups, and how do these relate to disease outcomes?

3. How do uninsurance rates vary across racial and income groups? 

4. Do income level and uninsurance rates correlate with chronic disease prevalence and preventive health measure usage?

# Statistical Analysis

To begin addressing our first research question, we created a bar plot visualizing the average crude prevalence of several chronic health conditions by race and ethnicity. We decided to investigate health disparities across racial and ethnic groups by examining the prevalence of seven specific health outcomes: <u>Alcohol use</u>, <u>Arthritis</u>, <u>Asthma</u>, <u>COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)</u>, <u>Diabetes</u>, <u>Disability</u>, and <u>Mental Health issues</u>. Each condition was averaged within each racial or ethnic category to allow for clearer comparisons across groups.

```{r}
#| echo: false
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(here)))
suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))
cdi_data = readRDS(here::here("dataset", "dataclean.rds"))

# Filter for Race/Ethnicity data
race_health <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(StratificationCategory1 == "Race/Ethnicity", 
         (Topic == "Diabetes" & Question == "Diabetes among adults") |
    (Topic == "Asthma" & Question == "Current asthma among adults") |
    (Topic == "Arthritis" & Question == "Arthritis among adults") |
    (Topic == "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" & Question == "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among adults") |
    (Topic == "Alcohol" & Question %in% c("Binge drinking prevalence among adults", "Binge drinking prevalence among high school students")) |
    (Topic == "Mental Health") |
    (Topic == "Disability")) %>%
  group_by(StratificationID1, Topic) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(DataValue, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(StratificationID1 = factor(StratificationID1, 
         levels = c("WHT", "BLK", "HIS", "MRC", "AIAN", "API", "HAPI", "ASN"),
         labels = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Multiracial", 
                    "American Indian/Alaska Native", "Asian/Pacific Islander", 
                    "Hawaiian/Pacific Islander", "Asian")))

# Create bar plot
ggplot(race_health, aes(x = StratificationID1, y = AverageValue, fill = Topic)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Disease Prevalence by Race/Ethnicity",
       x = "Race/Ethnicity",
       y = "Average Crude Prevalence of Condition",
       fill = "Health Condition") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The bar chart shown above highlights distinct disparities in chronic disease prevalence. Notably, Multiracial and American Indian/Alaska Native populations consistently exhibit higher rates across multiple conditions, with especially elevated levels for Disability and Arthritis concerns. In contrast, Asian populations generally report lower average prevalence across all conditions analyzed. These patterns suggest that chronic disease burdens are not distributed equally and may reflect underlying structural inequities in healthcare access, environmental exposures, or social determinants of health.

This initial visualization provides a compelling entry point into our analysis. It not only supports the presence of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease prevalence, but also sets the stage for more detailed investigation into the socioeconomic and preventive care factors that may be contributing to these outcomes.

To explore our second research question—*What are the patterns of preventive health measure usage among racial and ethnic groups, and how do these relate to disease outcomes?*—we visualized the average percentage of adults engaging in four key preventive health behaviors, broken down by race and ethnicity.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Define the questions of interest
preventive_questions <- c(
  "Influenza vaccination among adults",
  "Routine checkup within the past year among adults",
  "Colorectal cancer screening among adults aged 45-75 years",
  "Received health care provider counseling for physical activity among adults with arthritis"
)

# Filter the dataset for those questions
preventive_data <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(Question %in% preventive_questions)

# Filter for Race/Ethnicity data and specific preventive measures
preventive_race_data <- cdi_data %>%
  filter(StratificationCategory1 == "Race/Ethnicity", 
         Question %in% preventive_questions) %>%
  group_by(StratificationID1, Question) %>%
  summarise(AverageValue = mean(DataValue, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(StratificationID1 = factor(StratificationID1, 
         levels = c("WHT", "BLK", "HIS", "MRC", "AIAN", "API", "HAPI", "ASN"),
         labels = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Multiracial", 
                    "American Indian/Alaska Native", "Asian/Pacific Islander", 
                    "Hawaiian/Pacific Islander", "Asian")))

ggplot(preventive_race_data, aes(x = StratificationID1, y = AverageValue, group = Question, color = Question)) +
  geom_line() +  # Connect points with lines
  geom_point(size = 3) +  # Add points for visibility
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Preventive Health Measures Among Adults by Race/Ethnicity",
       x = "Race/Ethnicity",
       y = "Average Percentage (%)",
       color = "Preventive Health Measure") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 15, hjust = 1),
    axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -1),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.box = "vertical",   # Ensure the legend is stacked vertically
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 2, "cm")
  ) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 1))  # Arrange legend items vertically
  
```

The graph above illustrates trends across the following categories:

- Colorectal cancer screening among adults aged 45–75 years

- Influenza vaccination among adults

- Counseling for physical activity among adults with arthritis

- Routine checkup within the past year among adults

This visualization highlights several important patterns. First, routine checkups maintain relatively high participation across all racial groups, with especially high rates among Black and Multiracial populations. However, when it comes to influenza vaccination, participation is markedly lower overall, with Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations showing the lowest averages—suggesting potential barriers to access or vaccine hesitancy in these communities.

The colorectal cancer screening and physical activity counseling among adults with arthritis show a more uneven distribution. The Asian and White populations tend to have higher rates of colorectal screening, while Multiracial and American Indian/Alaska Native groups show moderately lower usage. Counseling for physical activity shows notable dips for Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Multiracial populations, which may point to inconsistencies in healthcare provider practices or systemic disparities in arthritis care.

Taken together, these disparities in preventive measure usage may help explain some of the patterns seen in chronic disease prevalence. For instance, groups with consistently lower rates of screenings and vaccinations—such as American Indian/Alaska Native and Multiracial populations—also showed higher rates of chronic conditions in our earlier analysis. This reinforces the idea that inequities in preventive care access may contribute to unequal health outcomes.


-> To further explore the systemic factors influencing health disparities, we turn to insurance coverage. Insurance access is a key determinant of preventive care and chronic disease outcomes. By examining insurance coverage across racial and income groups, we aim to understand how structural inequalities in healthcare access contribute to the disparities observed in earlier sections.

```
First, convert the text type of insurance to numeric type to facilitate subsequent calculations, then group by Race and Income, and calculate the average insurance rate for each group. Finally, use ggplot2 to draw a bar chart comparing the average insurance coverage rate of each ethnic group at different income levels. Based the output result, Across all income brackets, AIAN (American Indian/Alaska Native) and HIS (Hispanic) groups show lower insured rates.WHT (White) and ASN (Asian) groups tend to have the highest insurance coverage, often exceeding 90%.Income Level Correlates Positively with Insurance.As we move from <135% poverty to All, there's a general upward trend in insurance coverage across all racial groups.This confirms the expected pattern: higher income is associated with better insurance coverage.

# Modeling and Inference

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(broom)

# Linear model: Predicting insurance coverage by Race and Income
model <- lm(PCTIC ~ Race + Income, data = data)

# Model summary
summary(model)

# Model diagnostics: RMSE, MSE, and R²
model_perf <- augment(model)

# Calculate performance metrics
mse <- mean(model_perf$.resid^2, na.rm = TRUE)
rmse <- sqrt(mse)
r_squared <- summary(model)$r.squared

# Print performance metrics
cat("Model Performance Metrics:\n")
cat("MSE:", round(mse, 3), "\n")
cat("RMSE:", round(rmse, 3), "\n")
cat("R-squared:", round(r_squared, 3), "\n")




```
We build a linear regression model to estimate insurance coverage rates (PCTIC) based on race and income. This approach allows us to quantify the extent to which these two demographic factors contribute to disparities in insurance access. The model provides both explanatory insight and a quantitative basis for policy discussion.

First, a linear regression model was fitted with insurance coverage as the dependent variable and both race and income as independent variables. The detailed summary statistics of the regression model provide insights into the strength and significance of these predictors.

To assess model performance, predicted values and residuals were obtained from the model. From these residuals, the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) were calculated. MSE indicates the average squared difference between observed and predicted values, providing an overall measure of prediction error magnitude. RMSE, the square root of MSE, gives a more intuitive measure of the average prediction error. The R-squared value indicates the proportion of the variance in insurance coverage explained by the race and income predictors; a higher R-squared value implies better predictive power.

The calculated performance metrics are as follows:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)

These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation of how well race and income can predict insurance coverage.

## Flaws and limitations in analysis

**No causality** – The analysis is based on cross-sectional observational data, which can reveal associations but not establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.

**Simplified model** - The linear regression model assumes linear relationships and does not account for potential interactions or non-linear effects. Key predictors such as education level, employment status, or geographic access to healthcare are not included and may confound the observed relationships.

**Small sample sizes** – Some racial and income subgroups (e.g., Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or specific income brackets) have relatively small sample sizes, which may reduce statistical reliability and generalizability for those groups.

**Data merging challenges** – Merging datasets with differing structures, time frames, or levels of geographic granularity may introduce inconsistencies or measurement errors. For instance, state-level averages may obscure important within-state variation or neighborhood-level disparities.

**Unmeasured factors** – Factors such as language barriers, immigration status, healthcare provider bias, or local public health infrastructure were not captured in the datasets but may significantly affect both insurance access and chronic disease outcomes.

**Aggregation bias** – Because our analyses are conducted at the state and subgroup levels, they may mask local nuances and individual-level variation. This can lead to aggregation bias, where trends observed in the data do not necessarily reflect the experiences of individuals within those groups.
