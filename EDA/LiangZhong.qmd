## focusing on how the frequency of alcohol consumption is associated with depression scores in high school students. Specifically, we can filter our dataset to include only high school-aged individuals, then create scatter plots and perform a linear regression analysis to quantify the relationship. Initial results suggest that higher alcohol consumption is linked to higher depression scores, indicating that alcohol use might be a contributing risk factor for depression in this population.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Load the cleaned dataset
dataclean <- readRDS("dataclean.rds")

# Filter the data for high schoolers (assuming ages 14-18 represent high school students)
highschoolers <- dataclean %>% filter(age >= 14, age <= 18)

# Create a scatter plot with a linear trend line
ggplot(highschoolers, aes(x = alcohol_consumption, y = depression_score)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Alcohol Consumption vs. Depression in High Schoolers",
       x = "Alcohol Consumption (frequency per week)",
       y = "Depression Score") +
  theme_minimal()

# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(depression_score ~ alcohol_consumption, data = highschoolers)
summary(model)

```
