    "text": "This week, we built upon our exploratory data analysis and identified some discrepancies related to age data. Specifically, we found inconsistencies in the age groups within the StratificationID1 column. To better understand how these discrepancies might impact the analysis of different health conditions, we first examined the extent to which each age group had been analyzed.\n\nFrom the graph above, it became clear that not all health conditions were analyzed for every age group, and there was a lack of consistency in the age group ranges. For example, we observed both a 10-14 age group and a 12-17 age group, which indicate overlap and potential misclassification. We took these findings into account as we continued with our analysis.\nNext, we decided to investigate health disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Specifically, we visualized how the prevalence of four health outcomes—Arthritis, Asthma, Disability, and Mental Health—varies by race and ethnicity.\n\nThe bar chart shown above highlights clear disparities, with some conditions disproportionately affecting specific racial groups. For example, Multiracial and American Indian/Alaska Native groups consistently show higher average rates across multiple conditions, particularly for Disability and Mental Health, while Asian populations generally report lower values across the board. This visualization offers a meaningful entry point into the structural inequities embedded in public health outcomes and suggests important directions for deeper statistical analysis.\n  \nTo explore these relationships more rigorously, we fit a set of simple linear regression models to predict each of the four health outcome rates using three main predictors: YearStart, Location, and Race/Ethnicity (via the StratificationID1 column). A small portion of our modeling results is shown above; the modeling results confirmed some patterns from the EDA. For example, in the Disability model, race emerged as a significant predictor: the coefficients for American Indian/Alaska Native (+14.78), Multiracial (+10.53), and Hispanic (+3.23) were all statistically significant with p-values &lt; 0.001, indicating strong disparities. Similarly, in the Arthritis model, race also showed significance: the Asian group had a significantly lower rate (−10.96), while the Black and Multiracial groups had higher average rates. Location was also an important factor in many models, with states like California, New York, and Maryland frequently showing significant coefficients. While these are just initial models, they already suggest important structural differences in chronic disease rates by both race and geography. Moving forward, we hope to refine these models and explore potential mediating variables such as social determinants of health."

    "text": "Updates:\nThis week, we worked on investigating our data’s background, as well as importing and cleaning out our data. The U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to their website, the purpose of this dataset is to allow states and territories to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice in their area. The data was collected through a variety of surveys conducted by multiple organizations, including the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. Each row of the dataset contains the original study, survey or system that the information came from in a column labelled “DataSource”.\nOne potential issue with the data collection process is that the dataset compiles information from multiple sources, each with its own methodology, sample population, and limitations. For example, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) relies on telephone surveys, which may underrepresent individuals without stable phone access. Similarly, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) focuses on high school students, potentially excluding young people who are not enrolled in school. Because the sample populations and data collection methods vary across sources, disparities in representation could introduce biases, particularly regarding racial and socioeconomic groups that may be underrepresented in certain surveys. Nonetheless, this dataset has been widely used for public health research and policymaking; researchers have used CDI data to examine trends in chronic disease prevalence, assess health disparities, and guide public health interventions. Government agencies and policymakers leverage the data to allocate resources, design prevention programs, and inform legislative decisions related to chronic disease management. Given its broad scope, the CDI dataset provides a valuable foundation for studying racial health inequities, but careful attention must be given to data limitations and potential biases in interpretation.\nTo begin importing and cleaning out data, we first imported the US Chronic Disease Indicator CSV file. From there, we cleaned up the data by selecting specific columns to analyze: YearStart, LocationDesc, Topic, Question, DataValueType, DataValue, StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategoryID1, and StratificationID1.\n\nVariable Description:\nYearStart: The year when the data was collected\nLocationDesc: State\nTopic: The general category of the health data\nQuestion: A specific health-related question\nDataValueType: The type of data value (e.g., mean, median, prevalence ).\nDataValue: The actual numerical value.\nStratificationCategory1, and StratificationID1: Variables relating to age, sex, and race/ethnicity"

Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Dataset 1: U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)\nThe CDI dataset was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and developed through a consensus process involving the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. The data is collected to support public health surveillance, policy development, and program planning at state and national levels. This comprehensive dataset consists of 309,215 rows and 34 columns, and includes 115 indicators spanning various health topics such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, and social determinants of health.\nAfter downloading the csv file for the data, we can load it into R using read.csv(). Potential cleaning steps include managing multiple stratification variables (the dataset includes StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategory2, etc.), addressing missing values, converting location identifiers to meaningful geographic variables, and creating derived variables for time-based analysis (the data includes YearStart and YearEnd, which have years spanning 2015-2022). Some of the main questions we hope to address are how racial disparities in disease prevalence and management vary across different states/regions, how racial disparities in chronic disease indicators have changed over time, and whether or not racial disparities in preventive health measures (like cancer screenings, vaccinations) correlate with disparities in disease outcomes. A few anticipated challenges include handling the volume of data, addressing any high-variance estimates (i.e. some racial/ethnic groups may have limited data in certain geographic areas), and effectively visualizing disparities across multiple dimensions (race, geography, time).\n\n\nDataset 2: Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD)\nPublished by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the MH-CLD is designed to compile demographic and mental health characteristics for clients who have received mental health services in facilities that report to state administrative data systems. Each state’s Mental Health Agency collects data on individuals who receive mental health services during a defined 12-month reporting period; this dataset contains information from the year 2022, consisting of 6,957,919 rows and 40 columns. The data was originally collected to support national mental health reporting and to inform policy decisions by providing insights into service usage across various demographics.\nWe can first load the data into RStudio by downloading the delimited data file and using read.csv(). We can then clean the dataset by handling missing values (e.g., dealing with the 14.3% missing responses for race), filtering records for relevance to our study, and rewriting categorical variables for clearer analysis. Some of the main questions we hope to address are what the most common disorders among different race groups are, how mental health outcomes differ based on race/ethnicity following service utilization, and what the racial disparities in mental health service are across different demographic groups. A few challenges we may face during our project include scaling down the data, and making sure to consider that different states may have varied definitions or categorizations of diagnoses and service types, affecting comparability.\n\n\nDataset 3: National Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race\nThis data derives from a larger study aimed at understanding the impact of parent income on children’s outcomes. The dataset was constructed using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Community Survey (ACS). Confidentiality was prioritized, with data being cleared through the Census Bureau’s Disclosure Review Board to protect individual identities. The data consists of 100 rows and 69 columns, and it covers children born between 1978 and 1983, focusing on various socio-economic indicators related to race and gender.\nWe can load the data into RStudio using read.csv(), and cleaning the data will involve handling missing values, ensuring numerical data are in the correct format for analysis, and removing any bins with suppressed data (as they won’t provide meaningful insights). Some of the main questions we hope to address are how racial disparities manifest in various child outcomes (education, employment, incarceration) based on parent income percentiles, how the mean child income rank differs based on parental homeownership/family structure, and what differences exist between children of different races and genders in terms of college attendance and marriage rates. Looking at the dataset, a few challenges we may face during our project include cleaning/better organizing the data, establishing statistically significant results in racial subgroups with smaller sample sizes, and interpreting correlation vs. causation between variables."

    "text": "Updates:\nThis week, we worked on reviewing the article on Data for Equity Principals and relating it to our own data. The first principle that we noted was the principle of justice, which emphasizes that the benefits and burdens of data collection should be fairly distributed. In public health research, some communities—particularly marginalized racial groups are frequently the subjects of study but do not always benefit from the findings. The CDI dataset contains health indicators stratified by race, which allows for the examination of disparities. However, it’s important that the analysis doesn’t focus solely on racial differences, but also considers systemic causes like unequal healthcare access and environmental conditions. Additionally, a limitation of our data is that the racial and ethnic groups are aggregated into broad categories (e.g., “black”, “hispanic”, “asian”), which can obscure important within-group differences. A more equitable approach would involve advocating for more granular racial and ethnic data collection, ensuring that diverse communities are accurately represented in health research.\nAnother principle we considered from the article is beneficence, which requires that data be used to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. When analyzing racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence, it is critical to avoid decontextualized comparisons that could reinforce implicit biases. For example, reporting that a certain racial group has higher obesity rates without discussing economic barriers to healthy food access could place blame on individuals rather than highlighting systemic issues. A responsible approach to beneficence could involve integrating policy implications into the analysis through extraneous datasets, such as how Medicaid expansion, neighborhood investments, or culturally competent healthcare programs might mitigate disparities. Additionally, ensuring that findings are shared with communities in accessible formats (e.g., community briefings, infographics) can help make data more actionable rather than extractive. However, there is potential for misuse if policymakers or media outlets selectively present statistics without context, reinforcing harmful narratives about certain racial groups rather than addressing systemic healthcare inequities. Misinterpretation of the data could lead to policies that once again blame individuals rather than targeting structural barriers to health equity.\n We also worked more on our data cleaning by eliminating any NA values and beginning our exploratory data analysis. To check for any unusual quantitative data values/handle outliers, we constructed a box plot using a standardized version of the DataValue column. When viewing the box plot, we noticed that there were 8 values that seemed unusually large, all corresponding to values greater than 1,000,000. Therefore, we filtered these values out of our dataset to prevent them from skewing our results and distorting our overall analysis.\n To identify any unusually frequent categorical values, particularly within the Location and Topic columns, we constructed bar charts to visualize their distribution. The Location data appeared relatively evenly distributed, indicating that no single state or territory was disproportionately represented. However, the Topic frequency graph, which is shown above, revealed significant disparities in data coverage across health topics. Certain topics, such as Cardiovascular Disease, Nutrition/Physical Activity/Weight, and Health Status, each had over 19,000 recorded values, whereas others, like Maternal Health and Chronic Kidney Disease, had fewer than 1,000 entries. This imbalance suggests that some chronic health conditions receive considerably more attention in data collection efforts, which may influence the scope of potential analyses and the conclusions drawn from this dataset."
