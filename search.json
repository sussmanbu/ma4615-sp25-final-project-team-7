    "text": "Thesis: The Hispanic and American Indian and Alaska Native race group have a lower insured rate compare to other ethnic groups, resulting in higher chronic disease prevalence.\nOur team has solidified the central thesis that will guide our final interpretations and visualizations. As a team, we have collectively focused our efforts throughout this project on identifying the key social and structural factors influencing chronic disease prevalence across racial groups in the U.S. After analyzing trends across race, insurance coverage, and chronic health conditions, we have found compelling evidence to support our thesis. Chronic diseases are disproportionately prevalent among minority racial groups in the United States, particularly Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native populations, and this disparity is strongly associated with lower rates of health insurance coverage within these communities.\n To polish our visualizations and tables, our group focused on both clarity and aesthetic appeal. For example, when creating a choropleth map to show disease cases across U.S. states, we started by summarizing the data to calculate total case counts by region. We then used ggplot2 to build a clean static map and applied color gradients that enhance readability. Instead of keeping the default color scheme, we chose a smoother green gradient to better reflect a health-related theme and reduce visual fatigue. We also formatted the legend using scaled units (thousands of cases) to make the data more digestible. Small details—like removing unnecessary axes and using theme_void()—helped draw attention directly to the data. These refinements made the visualization not only more informative but also more professional and visually engaging.\nWe also continued doing analysis on our secondary dataset. A recent analysis of health insurance coverage across multiple health conditions—such as diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and mental health—highlights the complex intersections of race, income, and access to care. \n Across the board, individuals from higher-income brackets consistently show higher insurance coverage, regardless of the specific health topic. This aligns with what we would expect: as income increases, so does access to employer-sponsored insurance. However, income alone does not explain the full story. When examining insurance coverage by race within each income bracket, stark differences emerge. Even at the same income level, racial disparities in insurance coverage are evident. For instance, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native populations frequently show lower insurance rates than their White or Asian counterparts, even within the same poverty category. These gaps are visible across nearly every health condition, from chronic diseases to mental health concerns. This means that addressing economic inequality is necessary but not sufficient to achieve true health equity. Structural barriers—such as discrimination, lack of culturally appropriate care, documentation status, and systemic exclusion from employer-based coverage—continue to prevent equal access to insurance for many communities of color."

    "text": "Summary\nAs we approach the final stages of our project, this week was a chance to reflect on how far we’ve come, address any loose ends, and think more concretely about the Analysis and Big Picture sections of our final deliverable.\nWe’ve spent the past several weeks working with the CDC’s Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset, focusing on chronic disease prevalence by race, geography, and other stratifying variables. Along the way, we’ve addressed outliers, inconsistencies in age groups, topic imbalances, and missing data. We’ve also framed our work through the lens of data equity, being mindful of how disparities are interpreted and communicated.\nTo deepen our analysis, we merged the CDI data with the SAHIE dataset, which provided us with valuable information on health insurance coverage by income, race, and geography. This added an important layer to our exploration, allowing us to investigate not just who experiences worse health outcomes, but how insurance coverage and income levels might affect chronic disease outcomes in various racial and ethnic groups.\n\nThis week, we decided to incorporate an additional plot to examine the impact of uninsured rates (from our second dataset) on the prominence of disease by race (using variables from our initial dataset). The resulting figure displays the relationship between the average prevalence of various chronic health outcomes and the percentage of uninsured individuals, grouped by race. Across several outcomes—including disability, diabetes, and arthritis—a noticeable trend emerges: groups with higher uninsured rates, particularly American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) and Hispanic populations, often report higher prevalence rates. Conversely, Asian (ASN) individuals consistently report both lower uninsured rates and better health outcomes across most conditions. While not every outcome shows a strong linear trend, the overall pattern suggests that access to health insurance may play a role in shaping disparities in chronic disease prevalence among racial and ethnic groups. This visual provides an important stepping stone toward understanding how structural barriers, like lack of insurance, contribute to unequal health burdens in the U.S.\n\n\nAdditional Analysis\nAs we look ahead, we’ve identified several possible directions to strengthen our final analysis:\n\nIntersectional Modeling: Now that we have race, income, and insurance status, we can include interaction terms (e.g., Race × Income) in our regression models to explore how disparities compound across identities.\nGeographic Patterns: We may explore insurance or disease prevalence by state.\nTime Trends (if feasible): Although we’ve focused on 2022, the CDI dataset includes multiple years. If time allows, we may incorporate a time component to observe how disparities have changed over time.\n\n\n\nWhat We Have Left\nAs we approach the final stretch, our main priorities include finalizing the regression models—particularly those that incorporate interaction terms such as Race × Income or Insurance × Race—to deepen our intersectional analysis. We also plan to select the most compelling visualizations, including maps and scatter plots, to effectively communicate our findings. Writing the Analysis section will be a key next step, where we’ll focus on interpreting statistical results and highlighting patterns in health disparities. We have already begun drafting the Analysis section this week, with plans to finalize it within the next week or so.\nIn addition, we need to complete the Big Picture section by tying our findings back to broader issues in public health and health equity. On the logistical side, we’ll review and clean up our code to ensure it’s reproducible and well-documented, finalize all written sections of the report—including Methods and Data Cleaning—and begin assembling any presentation materials we may need. Finally, we’ll review everything as a group to ensure clarity and cohesion before submitting the final deliverable."

    "text": "This week, we built upon our exploratory data analysis and identified some discrepancies related to age data. Specifically, we found inconsistencies in the age groups within the StratificationID1 column. To better understand how these discrepancies might impact the analysis of different health conditions, we first examined the extent to which each age group had been analyzed.\n\nFrom the graph above, it became clear that not all health conditions were analyzed for every age group, and there was a lack of consistency in the age group ranges. For example, we observed both a 10-14 age group and a 12-17 age group, which indicate overlap and potential misclassification. We took these findings into account as we continued with our analysis.\nNext, we decided to investigate health disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Specifically, we visualized how the prevalence of four health outcomes—Arthritis, Asthma, Disability, and Mental Health—varies by race and ethnicity.\n\nThe bar chart shown above highlights clear disparities, with some conditions disproportionately affecting specific racial groups. For example, Multiracial and American Indian/Alaska Native groups consistently show higher average rates across multiple conditions, particularly for Disability and Mental Health, while Asian populations generally report lower values across the board. This visualization offers a meaningful entry point into the structural inequities embedded in public health outcomes and suggests important directions for deeper statistical analysis.\n  \nTo explore these relationships more rigorously, we fit a set of simple linear regression models to predict each of the four health outcome rates using three main predictors: YearStart, Location, and Race/Ethnicity (via the StratificationID1 column). A small portion of our modeling results is shown above; the modeling results confirmed some patterns from the EDA. For example, in the Disability model, race emerged as a significant predictor: the coefficients for American Indian/Alaska Native (+14.78), Multiracial (+10.53), and Hispanic (+3.23) were all statistically significant with p-values &lt; 0.001, indicating strong disparities. Similarly, in the Arthritis model, race also showed significance: the Asian group had a significantly lower rate (−10.96), while the Black and Multiracial groups had higher average rates. Location was also an important factor in many models, with states like California, New York, and Maryland frequently showing significant coefficients. While these are just initial models, they already suggest important structural differences in chronic disease rates by both race and geography. Moving forward, we hope to refine these models and explore potential mediating variables such as social determinants of health."

    "text": "Updates:\nThis week, we worked on investigating our data’s background, as well as importing and cleaning out our data. The U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to their website, the purpose of this dataset is to allow states and territories to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice in their area. The data was collected through a variety of surveys conducted by multiple organizations, including the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. Each row of the dataset contains the original study, survey or system that the information came from in a column labelled “DataSource”.\nOne potential issue with the data collection process is that the dataset compiles information from multiple sources, each with its own methodology, sample population, and limitations. For example, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) relies on telephone surveys, which may underrepresent individuals without stable phone access. Similarly, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) focuses on high school students, potentially excluding young people who are not enrolled in school. Because the sample populations and data collection methods vary across sources, disparities in representation could introduce biases, particularly regarding racial and socioeconomic groups that may be underrepresented in certain surveys. Nonetheless, this dataset has been widely used for public health research and policymaking; researchers have used CDI data to examine trends in chronic disease prevalence, assess health disparities, and guide public health interventions. Government agencies and policymakers leverage the data to allocate resources, design prevention programs, and inform legislative decisions related to chronic disease management. Given its broad scope, the CDI dataset provides a valuable foundation for studying racial health inequities, but careful attention must be given to data limitations and potential biases in interpretation.\nTo begin importing and cleaning out data, we first imported the US Chronic Disease Indicator CSV file. From there, we cleaned up the data by selecting specific columns to analyze: YearStart, LocationDesc, Topic, Question, DataValueType, DataValue, StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategoryID1, and StratificationID1.\n\nVariable Description:\nYearStart: The year when the data was collected\nLocationDesc: State\nTopic: The general category of the health data\nQuestion: A specific health-related question\nDataValueType: The type of data value (e.g., mean, median, prevalence ).\nDataValue: The actual numerical value.\nStratificationCategory1, and StratificationID1: Variables relating to age, sex, and race/ethnicity"

This cleaned dataset allows us to analyze health insurance coverage across different states in a more focused manner, examining how it varies by sex, race, and age, as well as how income levels affect insurance rates—particularly in relation to the topics covered in our first dataset.\nWe have selected the following key variables for our analysis:\n\n\n\nKey Variables in the SAHIE 2022 Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAge\nAge category for the demographic group (e.g., Under 65, 18–64, 50–64)\n\n\nRace\nRace category (e.g., White alone, Black or African American alone, Hispanic or Latino)\n\n\nSex\nSex of the demographic group (Male, Female, or Both)\n\n\nIncome\nIncome category, based on percentage of the federal poverty level (e.g., ≤138%, ≤400%)\n\n\nNIPR\nEstimated number of people in the demographic group for a given income category\n\n\nNUI\nEstimated number of uninsured individuals in the demographic group\n\n\nNIC\nEstimated number of insured individuals in the demographic group\n\n\nPCTUI\nEstimated percentage of people uninsured in the demographic group\n\n\nPCTIC\nEstimated percentage of people insured in the demographic group\n\n\nLocation\nName of the state (e.g., California, Texas)\n\n\nYear\nThe year the estimate was generated (2022)"

    "text": "Data Imbalances and Distribution\nTo explore the distribution of key variables in the SAHIE 2022 dataset, we examined the frequency of observations across several demographic and geographic categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of age groups is mostly consistent across the dataset, with one notable exception: the Under 18 category appears significantly less frequently than the other age groups. This suggests that the dataset primarily focuses on adult populations, which aligns with the dataset’s goal of measuring health insurance coverage in working-age groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the first dataset we analyzed, the SAHIE dataset shows a remarkably balanced distribution across race categories, income brackets, and states/territories. Each race group (e.g., White alone, Black alone, Hispanic/Latino) appears with similar frequency, and all income categories and U.S. locations are represented relatively evenly. This indicates that the dataset is not biased toward any specific population group or region, making it well-suited for demographic comparisons and equity-focused policy analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a histogram of the percentage of uninsured individuals (PCTUI) reveals a right-skewed distribution, with most values clustering between 10% and 25%. The peak occurs around 15%, indicating that the majority of geographic and demographic groupings fall within this moderate uninsured rate range. However, the long right tail—extending past 40%—shows that some populations experience significantly higher uninsured rates. This variation highlights persistent disparities in access to health coverage and supports the need for targeted policy interventions."

We also renamed columns for readability (e.g., state_name became LocationDesc) as well as easier implementation with our first dataset.\nRecoded Categorical Variables: The original dataset encoded demographic categories numerically. We recoded Age, Race, Sex, and Income into meaningful labels (e.g., Race == 2 became “BLK” for Black or African American).\nConverted Data Types: Some numerical values (e.g., population counts and percentages) were stored as character strings with formatting symbols like commas and percent signs. We stripped these symbols and converted the values to numeric format to enable analysis.\n\nThis cleaning process ensured the dataset was consistent, interpretable, and analysis-ready\n\nCleaned Dataset File:\nYou can download the cleaned dataset used in our analysis here: Cleaned SAHIE Data\n\n\nCleaning Script:\nFor full transparency, our data cleaning script is available for review: Cleaning Script for SAHIE"

This project also seeks to examine the relationship between preventive health measures—such as vaccination rates and cancer screenings—and chronic disease outcomes, with a focus on potential gaps in access and utilization. By incorporating data on income levels and insurance coverage, the analysis aims to uncover how socioeconomic factors contribute to these health disparities. Understanding these relationships can help identify the most influential factors affecting chronic disease prevalence and support efforts to improve health equity and outcomes nationwide."

    "text": "Key Findings From Model Output\n\nRace was a strong predictor of disease prevalence. All race categories had large negative coefficients relative to the reference category. For instance, identifying as Asian (RaceASN) was associated with an average 13.99-point lower prevalence rate (p &lt; 0.000001 - way below the 0.05 threshold), and identifying as Black (RaceBLK) corresponded to a 7.60-point lower rate.\nSex was a statistically significant but modest predictor of disease prevalence. Compared to the reference category, identifying as female was associated with a 0.09-point lower average prevalence rate (p = 0.0226), while identifying as male corresponded to a 0.10-point higher rate (p = 0.0121). Although these effects were statistically significant, the magnitude of the differences was relatively small compared to other predictors such as race.\nIncome showed a negative relationship with disease prevalence, consistent with prior expectations. While the differences for low-income groups (&lt;200%, &lt;250% poverty) were not significant, the more inclusive groups (e.g., All, &lt;400%, 138–400%) showed statistically significant decreases in prevalence, with p-values &lt; 0.000001.\nPCTIC (Percent Insured) was a highly significant and positive predictor, with a coefficient of 0.045 (p &lt; 0.000001). This finding supports the idea that areas with higher insurance coverage also report higher disease prevalence—likely due to better detection, screening, and diagnosis rates, rather than higher true incidence."

The cross-validated R-squared value of 0.14 indicates that the model explains about 14% of the variation in disease prevalence—a modest but meaningful amount given the complexity of health outcomes and the diversity of diseases included. While the model has limitations in predictive power, it does capture statistically and substantively meaningful patterns related to race, income, and insurance access."

But beneath these common culprits lies a more systemic, and deeply unequal, truth: race and insurance status in the United States are powerful predictors of chronic disease — sometimes more than income or even gender.\nAcross the country, millions live with conditions like diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and mental health struggles. But our analysis of public health survey data reveals that minority racial and ethnic groups, especially Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Native populations, consistently bear the greatest burden of these conditions. The reason isn’t just about biology — it’s about access, opportunity, and the uneven structure of the American healthcare system."

    "text": "Dataset 1: U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)\nThe CDI dataset was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and developed through a consensus process involving the CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. The data is collected to support public health surveillance, policy development, and program planning at state and national levels. This comprehensive dataset consists of 309,215 rows and 34 columns, and includes 115 indicators spanning various health topics such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, and social determinants of health.\nAfter downloading the csv file for the data, we can load it into R using read.csv(). Potential cleaning steps include managing multiple stratification variables (the dataset includes StratificationCategory1, StratificationCategory2, etc.), addressing missing values, converting location identifiers to meaningful geographic variables, and creating derived variables for time-based analysis (the data includes YearStart and YearEnd, which have years spanning 2015-2022). Some of the main questions we hope to address are how racial disparities in disease prevalence and management vary across different states/regions, how racial disparities in chronic disease indicators have changed over time, and whether or not racial disparities in preventive health measures (like cancer screenings, vaccinations) correlate with disparities in disease outcomes. A few anticipated challenges include handling the volume of data, addressing any high-variance estimates (i.e. some racial/ethnic groups may have limited data in certain geographic areas), and effectively visualizing disparities across multiple dimensions (race, geography, time).\n\n\nDataset 2: Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD)\nPublished by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the MH-CLD is designed to compile demographic and mental health characteristics for clients who have received mental health services in facilities that report to state administrative data systems. Each state’s Mental Health Agency collects data on individuals who receive mental health services during a defined 12-month reporting period; this dataset contains information from the year 2022, consisting of 6,957,919 rows and 40 columns. The data was originally collected to support national mental health reporting and to inform policy decisions by providing insights into service usage across various demographics.\nWe can first load the data into RStudio by downloading the delimited data file and using read.csv(). We can then clean the dataset by handling missing values (e.g., dealing with the 14.3% missing responses for race), filtering records for relevance to our study, and rewriting categorical variables for clearer analysis. Some of the main questions we hope to address are what the most common disorders among different race groups are, how mental health outcomes differ based on race/ethnicity following service utilization, and what the racial disparities in mental health service are across different demographic groups. A few challenges we may face during our project include scaling down the data, and making sure to consider that different states may have varied definitions or categorizations of diagnoses and service types, affecting comparability.\n\n\nDataset 3: National Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race\nThis data derives from a larger study aimed at understanding the impact of parent income on children’s outcomes. The dataset was constructed using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Community Survey (ACS). Confidentiality was prioritized, with data being cleared through the Census Bureau’s Disclosure Review Board to protect individual identities. The data consists of 100 rows and 69 columns, and it covers children born between 1978 and 1983, focusing on various socio-economic indicators related to race and gender.\nWe can load the data into RStudio using read.csv(), and cleaning the data will involve handling missing values, ensuring numerical data are in the correct format for analysis, and removing any bins with suppressed data (as they won’t provide meaningful insights). Some of the main questions we hope to address are how racial disparities manifest in various child outcomes (education, employment, incarceration) based on parent income percentiles, how the mean child income rank differs based on parental homeownership/family structure, and what differences exist between children of different races and genders in terms of college attendance and marriage rates. Looking at the dataset, a few challenges we may face during our project include cleaning/better organizing the data, establishing statistically significant results in racial subgroups with smaller sample sizes, and interpreting correlation vs. causation between variables."

The first principle that we noted was the principle of justice, which emphasizes that the benefits and burdens of data collection should be fairly distributed. In public health research, some communities—particularly marginalized racial groups are frequently the subjects of study but do not always benefit from the findings. The CDI dataset contains health indicators stratified by race, which allows for the examination of disparities. However, it’s important that the analysis doesn’t focus solely on racial differences, but also considers systemic causes like unequal healthcare access and environmental conditions. Additionally, a limitation of our data is that the racial and ethnic groups are aggregated into broad categories (e.g., “black”, “hispanic”, “asian”), which can obscure important within-group differences. A more equitable approach would involve advocating for more granular racial and ethnic data collection, ensuring that diverse communities are accurately represented in health research.\nAnother principle we considered from the article is beneficence, which requires that data be used to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. When analyzing racial disparities in chronic disease prevalence, it is critical to avoid decontextualized comparisons that could reinforce implicit biases. For example, reporting that a certain racial group has higher obesity rates without discussing economic barriers to healthy food access could place blame on individuals rather than highlighting systemic issues. A responsible approach to beneficence could involve integrating policy implications into the analysis through extraneous datasets, such as how Medicaid expansion, neighborhood investments, or culturally competent healthcare programs might mitigate disparities. Additionally, ensuring that findings are shared with communities in accessible formats (e.g., community briefings, infographics) can help make data more actionable rather than extractive. However, there is potential for misuse if policymakers or media outlets selectively present statistics without context, reinforcing harmful narratives about certain racial groups rather than addressing systemic healthcare inequities. Misinterpretation of the data could lead to policies that once again blame individuals rather than targeting structural barriers to health equity.\n We also worked more on our data cleaning by eliminating any NA values and beginning our exploratory data analysis. To check for any unusual quantitative data values/handle outliers, we constructed a box plot using a standardized version of the DataValue column. When viewing the box plot, we noticed that there were 8 values that seemed unusually large, all corresponding to values greater than 1,000,000. Therefore, we filtered these values out of our dataset to prevent them from skewing our results and distorting our overall analysis.\n To identify any unusually frequent categorical values, particularly within the Location and Topic columns, we constructed bar charts to visualize their distribution. The Location data appeared relatively evenly distributed, indicating that no single state or territory was disproportionately represented. However, the Topic frequency graph, which is shown above, revealed significant disparities in data coverage across health topics. Certain topics, such as Cardiovascular Disease, Nutrition/Physical Activity/Weight, and Health Status, each had over 19,000 recorded values, whereas others, like Maternal Health and Chronic Kidney Disease, had fewer than 1,000 entries. This imbalance suggests that some chronic health conditions receive considerably more attention in data collection efforts, which may influence the scope of potential analyses and the conclusions drawn from this dataset."

    "text": "Secondary Dataset: Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) using the American Community Survey (ACS)\nThis week, our team has decided we will be combining the SAHIE dataset with our original dataset (CDI - Chronic Disease Indicators) for a more in-depth analysis of chronic disease indicators. Since the SAHIE files are large and updated yearly, we are focusing on just the year 2022 for now, since it is the most recent year on file. The SAHIE dataset provides valuable information about health insurance coverage, as well as demographic factors such as race, age, sex, and income from the American Community Survey (ACS). By combining this with the CDI dataset, which focuses on chronic disease indicators across different states, we aim to explore how insurance coverage and income levels might influence chronic disease outcomes in various racial and ethnic groups.\nThe process of combining the two datasets began with cleaning and standardizing the SAHIE dataset. One of the most difficult parts of combining our two datasets was making sure the columns we wanted to merge on were consistent between both datasets. Therefore, we selected relevant columns, such as the year, race, sex, age, and income categories, and renamed them to align with the CDI dataset. In addition, we recoded categorical variables for race, age, sex, and income to ensure consistency between both datasets. For instance, we recoded race/ethnicity values from numeric codes in the SAHIE dataset (e.g., 1 for White, 2 for Black) into more descriptive categories like “WHT” for White, “BLK” for Black, and so on. We also standardized the age and income categories for better alignment.\nAfter cleaning the SAHIE dataset, we turned our attention to the CDI dataset. We filtered it to include only data from 2022 and focused on race/ethnicity stratifications, placing them into their own Race column. Additionally, we removed certain regions (e.g., Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico) from the CDI dataset, as they were not included within the SAHIE dataset. Once both datasets were cleaned and standardized, we proceeded with merging them using a left join on key columns: Year, LocationDesc (for state), and Race. This left join ensures that all rows from the CDI dataset are retained, and the matching data from the SAHIE dataset (providing health insurance coverage estimates) are added based on these common columns. This merged dataset will allow us to conduct more comprehensive analyses of how factors like insurance coverage, race, and income relate to chronic disease indicators in different states.\n Doing some basic analysis, our initial findings show that there is a positive relationship between income level and insurance coverage. Individuals in the lowest income bracket (&lt;135% poverty) have the lowest average insurance coverage, while those in higher income brackets have higher coverage rates. This highlights the income-based disparities in healthcare access.\n\nWe also see structural inequities in access to insurance exist by race and that increasing income doesn’t fully eliminate the gap. The graph shows that Hispanic and American Indian and Alaska Native tend to show lower coverage. These populations might face language, documentation, or systemic barriers that reduce access, even when income improves. Asian and White groups consistently show the highest coverage, which may be because they have better access to employer insurance, higher employment rates, or better eligibility navigation"

    "text": "As we approach the final stages of our project, we’ve made significant progress on the interactive component that will accompany our analysis. The goal of our interactive is to provide users with an engaging way to explore the prevalence of chronic disease outcomes across the U.S. by filtering on key dimensions. These specifically include disease topic, state, year, and demographic stratifications (age, sex, and race/ethnicity). We designed this tool with personalization and accessibility in mind, aiming to empower users to zoom in on trends most relevant to their own communities or interests—something that’s often not possible through static visuals alone.\nOur current interactive, built using Shinylive, allows users to select a disease topic from the CDC’s Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI), choose a state and year, and view a corresponding bar chart that breaks down disease prevalence across multiple stratification categories. We felt that this aligned well with the principles of a successful interactive: it facilitates both big-picture exploration and more targeted insights by enabling user input, while also offering contextual cues such as custom titles and a message prompt when no data is available for a selected filter. One of our goals with this design was to strike a balance between usability and depth, allowing users to observe racial or age-based disparities in disease data while maintaining an intuitive, responsive interface.\nAlthough the interactive is already functional, we’re continuing to iterate on its design. Some of our planned refinements include potentially removing years with sparse data (particularly 2018 and earlier), improving axis labels for clarity, and adding checkboxes to allow users to isolate specific stratification dimensions (such as race only, or age only) for more focused analysis. We also still need to move the tool to the Big Picture page on our project website and plan to do so very soon, integrating it with the broader narrative of our findings. In the final days of our project, we’ll be formally completing the Analysis and Big Picture pages, where our main results will be summarized, and producing a video walkthrough as a team to demonstrate how our interactive tool works and why it’s meaningful."
